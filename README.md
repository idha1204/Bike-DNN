#[1] The procedure for loading the Bikeshare data 

To load the Bikeshare data from the ISLR2 package in R into Python, you can follow this two-step process:

Step 1: Save the Bikeshare data as a CSV file in R

install.packages("ISLR2"); library(ISLR2) #Install and load ISLR2 package

write.csv(Bikeshare, file = "bike.csv", row.names = FALSE) #Save Bikeshare data to a CSV file

getwd() #Check the current working directory

Step 2: Load the CSV file into Python

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('bike.csv') #Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame

print(df.head()) #Display the first few rows of the DataFrame

#[2] We consider the following four models for fitting the Bikeshare data:

M1: LM

M2: Poi-GLM

M3: DNN

M4: Poi-DNN
